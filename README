The main objective of this program is to take a set of text files and analyze their similarity.
This program takes an input of files and directories.
From the directories, the code finds files with the appropriate suffix.
For each file, the file's word frequencies are calculated.
Then the code calculates the Jensen-Shannon distance (see JSD.png for equation) between each pair of files.

Uses multithreading

Arguments include:
    1. Normal arguments, which are: 
        files/directories
    2. Optional arguments, which are:
        "-dN"
            This argument determines the number of directory threads
            N is substituted with an int
        "-fN"
            This argument determines the number of file threads
            N is substituted with an int
        "-aN"
            This argument determines the number of analysis threads
            N is substituted with an int
        "-sS"
            This argument determines the appropriate suffix for text files
            S is substituted with a string
            
Word frequency is calculated by:
    (number of times the word appears)/(total number of words)
